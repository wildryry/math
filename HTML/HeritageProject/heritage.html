                    <p>
                        family is something I took for granted and never put time into learning about.
                        With this project now I need to learn about my family in order to have a project to submit.
                        After the chrismas event I realized that most of the people I saw I had no idea who they were which.
                        Something I thought was cool that we did was I created some pizza dough and it was enough for eight pizzas.
                        Dense &#40;the event was at his house and I don't know exactly how I'm related to him&#41; had made his own pizza oven that we used to bake our pizzas.

                    <h3>Why I made this for the project</h3>
                    <p>
                        Why create a website? Because I've learnt how to create on this semester &#40;2024-2025&#41; and couldn't think of another option.
                        Which resulted in Me creating this website as a heritage project.
