                        I don't see him often I know he loves fishing. 
                        So I end up seeing him either on zoom calls, fishing trips, or chrismas events.

                        he's the part of my heritage that is from trinidad.

                    <h4>from the interview:</h4>
                    <p>
                        He told me about his life in trinidad before he came to canada.
                        His family beileved in hinduism but in school he was taught christianity &#40; He didn't properly learn hindi&#41;.
                        In school he did very well and by the end of the his time there he started teaching in a primary school.
                        He worked there for four years and it was his first job.
                        Being able to Teach immediately after finishing high school seem weird but maybe teachers were far and few between.
