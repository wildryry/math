                        at first I was trying to draw a cat or something like it but I added 
                        a mouth that went in between its legs and lines on its front legs. 
                        I never had a Name for Half but when i was drawing it on 
                        paint<sup><!--make this smaller -->TM</sup> I only drew half of the image and so when
                        i named the png file i named it Half. I just never changed the
                        Named of it so it stuck.

                        The Lich or <i>The Last Scholar of Golb</i> is a pretty simple villian from <b>AT</b> &#40;Adventure Time&#41;. The Lich's 
                        Goal is simpaily to get rid of all life in the universe. Even though he has a simple cause his character is 
                        more complex. The Lich is <i>eternal</i> existing from start to finish and in ever universe.

                            <dd>first of all you can ignore what was writen because the indigenous stoies were very untrust worthy anyways</dd>
                            <dd>on the first question i drew a pyramid with bill cypher as the tip of the building and a time spirit casting a fire ball at him</dd>
                            <dd>on the second question I drew the eye of salron looking directly at a stick figure of a student not being heard setting him on fire</dd>
                            <dd>on the last question is a time spirit &#40;with it's mask off&#41; creating a thunder cloud in it's mask</dd>

                        I heavily doubt that you know what I mean by "time spirit". A time spirit is a enitiy made of a mud like substance controled with a soul. The sprites/spirits also have golden parts to keep the mud in place. A golden mask, and two golden bracelets give its shape.

                            31 ----ing percent and nothing but the same story over and over and over again. i wasn't even aware of austraila indigenous people and i've been learning the same thing for 5 years. This is the first time I learn they even exist.
