                                at first I was trying to draw a cat or something like it but I added 
                                a mouth that went in between its legs and lines on its front legs. 
                                I never had a Name for Half but when i was drawing it on 
                                paint<sup><!--make this smaller -->TM</sup> I only drew half of the image and so when
                                i named the png file i named it Half. I just never changed the
                                Named of it so it stuck.

                                I heavily doubt that you know what I mean by "time spirit". A time spirit is a enitiy made of a mud like substance controled with a soul. The sprites/spirits also have golden parts to keep the mud in place. A golden mask, and two golden bracelets give its shape.

                                    31 ----ing percent and nothing but the same story over and over and over again. i wasn't even aware of austraila indigenous people and i've been learning the same thing for 5 years. This is the first time I learn they even exist.
