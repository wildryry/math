                                I mentioned terminalmontage and Finn the human which one is a character and the other is a animator. terminalmontage has made many goofy and humoris cartoons including kirdy and for <i>legal</i> reasons &#40;mainly nintendo&#41; calls him kirbo. which is just kirby drawn in his own style.

                                I lost the first Sausage drawing but he'd always be near residential schools. So then he became someone who created residential schools, atleast in my mind. He has crosses in his eyes. That is meant to symbolize the religion that he brings.

                                I love to draw clouds. their simplicity makes it easy to draw, and added faces made them look even better. With the simplicity and the cute faces it made them an easy favorite at the time.
