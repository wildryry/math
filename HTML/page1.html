                        at first I was trying to draw a cat or something like it but I added <br>
                         a mouth that went in between its legs and lines on its front legs. <br>
                        I never had a Name for Half but when i was drawing it on <br>
                        paint<sup><!--make this smaller -->TM</sup> I only drew half of the image and so when <br>
                        i named the png file i named it Half. I just never changed the
                        Named of it so it stuck.

                            <dd>if you are unaware of what media Bill Cypher is from Bill is from the disney<sup><!-- make this smaller-->TM</sup> show Gravity Falls</dd>
                            <dd>Bill is simpliy a dream demon who appears only in dreams</dd>
                            <dd>he's holding out his hand because his main gimick is making deals with people where he does something for them and he gets to control their body in return &#40;he doesn't menion the controling your body part&#41;</dd>
                            <dd>he looks like the eye of providence because in Gravity Falls he met the founding fathers and asked them to put him on the dollar</dd>
                            <dd>Bill is saying "come on sixer" because in the book "The book of Bill" Bill gets block from entering a character call stanford's head because he found out bill was evil. He did this by puting a tin plate inside his head to prevent bill</dd>
